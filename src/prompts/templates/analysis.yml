        Available agents:
        {{agent_list}}
        
        Return a JSON list of [agent_id, confidence] pairs, where confidence is 0.0-1.0.
        Only include agents with confidence > {{confidence_threshold}}. If no agents are appropriate, return [].

        Available tools:
        {{tool_list}}

      template: |
        Original user request: {{prompt}}
        
        Multiple agents have provided responses to this request:
        
        {{responses_text}}
        
        Create a unified, coherent response that combines the most relevant information from each agent.
        Focus on addressing the original request completely and clearly.
        Eliminate redundancies and resolve any contradictions between the responses.
        Make the response flow naturally as if it came from a single source.
